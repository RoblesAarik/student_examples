        <p>
          Bridge is played with four people sitting at a card table using a
          standard deck of 52 cards (no jokers). The players across from each
          other form partnerships as North‑South and East‑West.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each deal consists of three parts – the auction, where the four
          players bid in a clockwise rotation describing their hands, the play,
          where the side that wins the bidding auction tries to take the tricks
          necessary to fulfill their contract, and scoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bidding is the language of bridge. Its purpose is to relay information
          about the strengths and weaknesses of each player’s hand to his
          partner. A bid consists of a number and a suit (spades (♠), hearts
          (♥), diamonds (♦), clubs (♣) or notrump (NT), a designation indicating
          no trump suit). The suits are assigned value with notrump the highest
          and clubs the lowest. A one heart bid means the pair intends to take
          six tricks plus one, or seven tricks total, with hearts as trump.
