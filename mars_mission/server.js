// * The app will need routes for index and show
// * The app will need views for index and show

// * Make it so you can click on a mission’s name on the index page, and be taken to that mission’s show page
// * Bonus: add images to the data and have them display
// * Bonus: add static css to style the pages

// DATA - put this into marsMissions.js file inside of a models folder, for module.exports
// remember to require it in the server

// INDEX Route
// send data to 'missions/index.ejs' view
// the view should display just the names of each mission
// Stretch: the names should provide a link to the show page

// SHOW Route
// send data to 'missions/show.ejs' view
// the view should display all the data for a single mission
// the view should have a link back to the index
// Stretch: display the image inside an image tag

// LISTENER
